Python scripts to simulate interactive games

## Snake

The snake script simulates the 1976 version of the classic Snake game. You increase in length as you eat more pieces of food. You don't want the snake to eat itself or bump into any walls. It uses the python [curses](https://docs.python.org/2/howto/curses.html) library for terminal-independent screen-painting and keyboard-handling. The script runs on Python 2.7.
